Short-Term content affecting overtourism

Lately everywhere I go it's overcrowded. Every spot is a tourist spot, and I believe social media plays a major role in it. Since social media, every UCG content, has been selling a dream instead of a product. I noticed that short-form content (reels/shorts) makes hidden places crowded, I've built a small data pipeline in Python to explore how social media interest might correlate with tourism growth over time. Usind datacleaning, feature creation and multiple visualizations like matplotlib and seaborn to represent the same. Dataset is simulated for practice.

Social Media Shorts/Reels and Tourism Growth

A beginner-friendly data visualization project in Python

Overview

Lately, many destinations that once felt quiet and hidden have become crowded tourist hotspots. Short-form social media content (Reels, Shorts, and other UGC) often amplifies “dream destinations” at scale, which may influence tourism patterns.

This project explores how social media interest might correlate with tourism growth over time using a small Python data pipeline. The goal is to practice real-world data workflows: cleaning messy data, creating features, and visualizing trends.

Note: The dataset used here is simulated for learning and experimentation.

What This Project Does

Loads and cleans messy CSV data (strings, percentages, missing values)

Creates features like a combined social media index and year-over-year growth

Visualizes trends with multiple chart types (line, bar, scatter, and map fallback)

Saves cleaned data and outputs for inspection

Tech Stack

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

(Optional) Plotly for map visualization

How to Run

Install dependencies:

pip3 install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly


Run the script:

python3 datascience.py


Check the outputs/ folder for generated charts and the cleaned dataset.

Sample Outputs

These are generated by the script:






Project Structure

datascience.py – main script (data creation, cleaning, features, visualizations)

data/ – dataset (auto-created if missing)

outputs/ – generated charts and cleaned CSV

Why This Project

This project turns a real-world observation about overtourism and social media amplification into a small, reproducible analysis pipeline. It’s designed as a learning piece and a foundation for future projects with real datasets.
